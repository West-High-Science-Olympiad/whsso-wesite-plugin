<h2>List of Modules</h2>
<p><b>Tabs</b><br>
    Tabs is a module designed initially for backend operation that creates a php function for extremely simple
    creation of a tabbed interface. It may be restyled universally using a small set of CSS classes. In addition
    to a simple and effective interface, the plugin saves the currently selected tab in the URL to sponsor generation
    of links to specific tabs and to improve the action of redirects.<br>

<p><b>Sticky Elements</b><br>
    Sticky Elements is a module that prevents elements on the frontend interface from disappering when the user
    scrolls down past it. Menus on the frontend are the primary target elements of this plugin.<br>
